This was truly my first “in person” internship in the sense that I actually had to relocate. Also, this is the first time I was really working with robotics outside a research or hobbyist setting.</p> <p>During my time at AR, I was able gain more software engineering skills. My project was to take perception algorithms for item picking tasks (including object segmentation and barcode detection), adapt them for the Jetson AGX Orin platform, and benchmark their performance. This exposed me to many of the perception algorithms used on Amazon’s warehouse manipulation robots.</p> <p>On a personal note, I was able to spend a decent chunk of time explore the cities of Boston and Cambridge. I’ve never actually lived in a large city (Athens is really just a college town and Atlanta isn’t very exciting), so I took advantage of the T and went exploring! I hit many of the tourist attractions (walking around North End, Chinatown, seeing MIT and Harvard) but by far my favorite thing was running along the Charles River! My daily routine was doing a 3 mile circuit in which I crossed both the Harvard and Longfellow bridges, both which have incredible views of the city.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/harvard-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/harvard-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/harvard-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/harvard.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="harvard bridge" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-3 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/longfellow-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/longfellow-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/longfellow-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/longfellow.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="longfellow bridge" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> From left to right: (1) View from Harvard Bridge (2) View from Longfellow Bridge </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="work"/><category term="work"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflecting at my time at AR!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First Conference!

I was able to cross this item off in my last semester by attending and submitting a demo for UbiComp/ISWC 2022.</p> <p>During the conference, I was able to sit through several panels, presentations, and keynote speaches and learn more about the other research areas in ubiquitous computing and HCI. I was able to see all the impressive hardware that other labs were developing, but I was also able to step outside my comfort zone and sit through presentations focused on AI, ethics, and psychology. After sitting down in a variety of presentations, I was truly able to appreciate the interdiscplinary aspect of the HCI field.</p> <p>Most imporantly, I was also able to share my own research with the community. As part of the demo track, I was able to walk conference attendees through the entire PHL system. My team and I demonstrated the learning system comprised with the custom web app, light up keyboard, and custom haptic gloves. We had several people come and try on the gloves and give feedback about what they felt about useability, comfort, and the haptic vibrations. It gave us valuable feedback that we could incorporate into future gloves and into the website.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/conference-poster-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/conference-poster-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/conference-poster-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/conference-poster.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="ubicomp/iswc poster" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Poster describing the PHL system </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="work"/><category term="work"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My experience at UbiComp/ISWC 2022]]></summary></entry></feed>
