Hello! My name is Asha Bhandarkar! 

I am currently completing my final semester as a Master's student at Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My main technical and research interests are in the areas of embedded systems, robotics, and wearable technology. I am currently a graduate research assistant in the School of Interactive Computing's [Contextual Computing Group](https://gvu.gatech.edu/research/labs/contextual-computing-group) working on hardware/firmware for the passive haptic learning project. 

Outside the classroom, you'll see me building robots for IGVC and RoboCup SSL through [RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org/) and volunteering at Georgia Tech's ECE Makerspace, the [Hive](https://hive.ece.gatech.edu/)! 

Here you'll find a selection of some of my past projects, updates on my current ones, and just some general updates I would like to share! If you have any questions or want to reach out, feel free to send me an email or connect on LinkedIn.
