Hello! My name is Asha Bhandarkar!

I am currently a software engineer at Texas Instruments working on the [Jacinto 7 processors](https://www.ti.com/video/series/jacinto7.html) for automotive applications. My main technical and research interests are in the areas of embedded systems and its intersections with wearable technology and robotics.

In the past year, I received a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  During my program, I worked in the School of Interactive Computing's [Contextual Computing Group](https://gvu.gatech.edu/research/labs/contextual-computing-group) working on hardware/firmware for the passive haptic learning project. Outside of my research, I was building robots for IGVC and RoboCup SSL through [RoboJackets](https://robojackets.org/) and volunteering at Georgia Tech's ECE Makerspace, the [Hive](https://hive.ece.gatech.edu/)!

Overall, I am extremely passionate about electronics and I've had amazing opportunities to work on so many different projects - spanning from electronics education, human devices, and underwater robots! Here, you'll find a selection of some of my past projects and general updates from me. It's a continuous work in progress so if you have any questions or want to reach out, feel free to send me an email or connect on LinkedIn.
